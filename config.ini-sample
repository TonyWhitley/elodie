# The identifiers month, year, location, city etc. are pre-defined by Elodie
month=%B
year=%Y
location=%city

# full_path is the name of the path where Elodie will put the files:
full_path=%month/%year/%album|%location|%"UnknownLocation"

# The result of that will  be
# November/2017/albumName        if the album name is known
# November/2017/London           if the location is known
# November/2017/UnknownLocation  otherwise
